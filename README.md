Mac OS X Google Translator context menu integration

If you are not native english speaker, you may be frustrated with default Look Up options. There are multiple dictionaries, wikipedia and news but your language is not listed here.Fortunately there is other option. 

Install this action script to get Google Translator inyour context menu, so you can just select and right click to get translation.
